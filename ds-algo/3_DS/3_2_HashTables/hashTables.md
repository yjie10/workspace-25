## Data Structures: Hash Tables

### Intro

Hash tables, aka hash maps, maps, unordered maps, dictionaries, objects, etc.

Objects in JS are a type of hash table.

With hash table, we get to set a key and a value:

```
basket.grapes = 10000; // key: grapes, value: 10000
```

The **key** is used as the index as where to find the **value** in memory.

Fast data access; Slow key iteration.

Big O:
insert O(1)
lookup O(1)
delete O(1)
search O(1)
space O(n)

#### Hash Function

Generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets.

It's one way -- no way to convert the hash back into the input.

And Hash will always be the same for the same input -- This is called **idempotent**.

### Hash Collisions

With limited memory and enough data, it's unavoidable there will be collision.

When collision happens, it slows down **reading** and **writing**. // O(1) -> O(n)

### Hash Tables vs Arrays

Hash tables are great when you want ...

- fast access to values (comparing to O(n) time for Arrays)
- insertion is O(1), can assume no collision in most cases (no need to shift elements like in Arrays)

Note there's no concept of order for Hash Tables, no guarantee elements are next to each other.

## Hash Tables Review

Again, Hash Tables are good for:

- Fast lookups \*Good collision resolution needed
- Fast inserts
- Flexible keys

Trade-offs: fast access, more memory.
