——「Will you solve the company's problem? 」

### What Are Companies Looking For?

1. Analytic Skills

3. Technical Skills
4. Communication Skills

#### Analytic Skills

How can you think through a problem and analyze things?
Thought process of solving a problem -- from not knowing the answer to solving the problem.

#### Coding Skills

Is your code clean, readable well-organized?

- Arrays
- Hash Tables
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
